order by shipment_month;

-- February shows more inbound than outbound â€” risk of overstocked inventory
-- outbound shipments spike at quarter start, suggesting planned restocking.
 -- No outbound shipments in 2024- Dec might point to low demand or late sales reporting.


-- 17. Which Mumbai destinations receive the highest number of outbound shipments?

select destination, count(*) as outbound_shipment_count
from Shipments
where shipment_type = 'outbound'
group by destination
order by outbound_shipment_count desc;

group by p.product_id, p.name
order by avg_days_to_sell;
 
 -- Addidas Sports Shorts takes short avgerage duration for sales indicating fast turnover- high demand, good inventory management for that product
 -- Dettol Handwash takes long avgerage duration for sales indicating slow turnover- low demand, poor inventory management and poor forecasting for that product


-- 23. Which products exhibit seasonality in their sales or purchase behavior?


select p.product_id, p.name as product_name, date_format(s.sale_date, '%Y-%m') as month,
		sum(s.quantity) as total_units_sold
from Products as p join Sales as s on p.product_id = s.product_id
group by p.product_id, p.name, month
order by month asc, total_units_sold desc; -- sales based Seasonality

-- Product â€˜Bournvitaâ€™ shows high sales in January, likely due to increased winter consumption.
-- Dettol Handwash spikes in May possibly linked to hygiene awareness


-- 24. Predict which products may go out of stock in the next 30 days based on average daily sales.

select p.product_id, p.name as product_name, i.current_stock,
    round(sum(s.quantity) / count(distinct s.sale_date), 2) as avg_daily_sales,

group by p.product_id, p.name, i.current_stock
having last_sold_date < current_date - interval 90 day
order by  current_stock desc;

--  Products with slow moving ( high current_stock) can be put on clearance sales by discounting them.

-- 27. Which products should be discontinued or replaced due to consistently low sales and high holding costs?

select p.product_id, p.name as product_name, sum(s.quantity) as total_units_sold,
    i.current_stock, round(i.current_stock * p.price * 0.0001, 2) as estimated_holding_cost,

					left join Sales as s on p.product_id = s.product_id
group by p.product_id, p.name, i.current_stock
having total_units_sold < 10 and days_since_last_sale > 90
order by estimated_holding_cost desc, days_since_last_sale desc;

--  Low sales volume (only 5 units sold in total)- Indicates weak demand or poor product-market fit.
-- Unsold inventory still exists (10 units)- Ties up space and capital.
-- Holding cost of 75 over 90 days- For a low-turnover product, thatâ€™s a relatively high cost.
-- Last sale was 148 days ago- signals slowing movement.
-- Suggests discount and replacement


-- 28. What is the total profit generated from each shipment destination (location), and which locations are most profitable?

select 
    sh.destination,
    sum(s.quantity * p.price) as total_revenue,
